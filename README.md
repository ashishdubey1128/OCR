# OCR
Reading text from images using windows form interface => Pleasure


The program solves the purpose of text recognition from images. It is written in C# and uses the tesseract-ocr engine by Google for the text reconigtion purpose. 


Moreover, the windows form provides a better interface for the users anytime.
PS: Visual Studio helped me to ease the job a lot.
